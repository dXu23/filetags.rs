#+TITLE: filetags.rs

filetags.rs is meant to be another version of Karl Voit's [[https://github.com/novoid/filetags/tree/master][filetags]]
software, except that it uses the file name format of Protesilaos's
[[https://github.com/protesilaos/denote][Denote]]. At the moment, the repo is very incomplete.
